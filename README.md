## About Untethered
Untethered is an architectural paradigm that aims to provide the building blocks that enable applications
to decouple, as much as possible, from the underlying framework. When applications are thought of and developed
as libraries/packages, even if never will be, upgrading the framework version or migrating frameworks altogether
becomes easier and more straightforward.

## Why Untethered
Untethering an application from its underlying framework promotes code reuse and sharing. When domain logic is
no longer coupled, it can be exposed by the framework as an API endpoint, command, or in whatever manner specific
functionality to be surfaced. Developing applications with the thought of them being a library/package allows
what would be a monolithic application to be split into services that use still use a certain amount of common code.
